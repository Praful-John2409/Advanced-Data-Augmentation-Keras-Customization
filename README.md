# ðŸ§  Advanced Data Augmentation & Keras Customization â€“ Colab Series

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for my multi-part deep learning assignment. This project demonstrates:

- A variety of **data augmentation and regularization techniques** across domains.
- Implementation of **advanced Keras constructs**, from custom losses to optimizers.
- Each section is structured into multiple Colab notebooks.
- All code is **original** (not copied from hint notebooks) and carefully explained in the walkthrough videos.

## ðŸŽ¥ Video Walkthroughs

Each Colab has been executed, explained, and narrated in a video walkthrough:

- ðŸ”— **[Part 1: Data Augmentation Walkthrough](./walkthrough_videos/part1_walkthrough.mp4)**
- ðŸ”— **[Part 2: Advanced Keras Constructs Walkthrough](./walkthrough_videos/part2_walkthrough.mp4)**

## ðŸ§ª Part 2: Advanced Keras Deep Learning Constructs

### ðŸ“˜ [1_custom_layers_losses_metrics.ipynb](#)
> **Focus**: Hands-on with custom objects in Keras.

- Built a **custom learning rate scheduler**
- Developed **custom dropout (MCAlphaDropout)** and **normalization**
